Before initializing the git make sure that we are in the right path. otherwise if we are in the root directory and do git init
it will include the entire root dir to the git.

to intialize the git:
git init

to know the status of the git:
git status

to add the file to the git staging:
git add filename

if there are lot of files to be added in staging dir:
git add .

to delete a file that is already there in the staging:
git rm filename
git rm -f filename//this will completly delete the file from the commit and wipe out the changes.

Inorder to not remove the file and to make the file to be untracked in the staging:

git rm --cached file.txt


to list all the git configs:

git config --list

before setting the commit for the file:
we need to set the username and email:

to set the name :
git config --global user.name "Kiran Kumar Seeram"
git config --global user.email "seeramkirankumar48@gmail.com"

to commit the changes to the git:

git commit -m "initial commit"

git commit will add all the tracked but not the untracked files

to add only the tracked& untracked files(edited) but not the new files:
git commit -a -m "initial commit"

to see the log of the commits:
git log

we can go to previous commit:
git checkout commit_id

//to get back to the latest:
git checkout master

in order to revert the code back:

git revert commit
//the git revert will revert only one commit at a time.
