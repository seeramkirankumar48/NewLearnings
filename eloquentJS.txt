Javascript:
-----------
to display the string we can use the console.log

//the string displayed with in double quotes or single quotes behave in the same way.but with the back ticks we can make use of the template indicator.

<script>
console.log(`half of 100 is:${100/2}`)
</script>

//the template indicator is $.

//In order to determine the type we can use the typeof

console.log(typeof 10)//number
console.log(typeof "x")//string

There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is
NaN (“not a number”).

console.log(NaN == NaN)

Logical Operators:
